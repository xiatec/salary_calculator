We all know someone who’s been affected by cancer, and we’ve proven that our technology can help get life-saving treatments to patients faster (https://people.com/health/teacher-brain-tumor-week-to-live-now-thriving/). Having already signed a set of Fortune 500 paying clients, we’re ramping up for our next phase of growth and are looking for a bold and self-motivated engineer to join us as we change healthcare for the better.

More about us:

Currently developing a single new drug can take over $1B and 15 years, with over 99% of drugs failing along the way. This is why over 70% of all known diseases have no treatments and millions of patients are left with no viable treatment options.

At OneThree Biotech we’re working to change this using biology-driven AI. Founded after members of our team lost family members to rare cancer, the team at OneThree has spent the last 5+ years researching how we can combine AI with systems biology to stop this from happening to anyone else. We’re building a platform to not only predict new potential therapeutics, but also to pinpoint the mechanisms driving efficacy, and we pride ourselves on building a new form of biology-driven AI that values interpretability as much as accuracy. After raising a multi-million round of funding, we’re looking for a Lead Data Engineer to join our interdisciplinary team as we look to ramp up external partnerships and internal development.

The ideal candidate will have an entrepreneurial mindset, be comfortable with creative problem solving, and will be excited to build a data processing pipeline from the ground-up in a flexible, fast-paced environment. This is a rare opportunity to get in at the early stage and take ownership over a product and strategy. If working on challenging problems that have a real positive impact excites you, then OneThree is the place for you!

Responsibilities:

• Help set company’s overall data strategy from developing technical

infrastructure to building the data engineering team

• Build scalable APIs for data access and modification

• Take ownership of building efficient data ingress pipelines for both existing

data assets and newly identified data sources

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today things are different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.

Some of the problems you will solve entail understanding data, identifying patterns, quantifying the impact of ML / NLP models and designing data visualizations. We seek a data scientist to help drive a new digital AI product team on a mission to unlock the potential of data and identify new opportunities.

As one of the founding members of a small, multi-disciplinary team of technologists, designers and product managers, you’ll have the freedom to make key product decisions without much oversight, and the tools and resources to build and ship ideas quickly.

K-means more than a curt text and Logit and Probit are not Hobbit characters.
You have experience with relational databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server, and maybe even Hadoop, Hive, Spark or Redshift.
You strive to learn the newest and greatest techniques where BERT/ELMo are not just Sesame Street© characters.
What you’ll own
The foundation for advanced analytics at a global company.
The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.
Manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation).
Sourcing new data for a firm that rarely scrapes, pulls or pushes.
Facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your users and technical teams.
Coordinate and build strong working relations with various internal stakeholder groups, including IT, engineering, and legal.
Minimum Qualifications
Degree in computer science, engineering, mathematics, statistics, data science or a related technical field, or equivalent practical experience.

We also recognize that the timeline for full-time start of this position may be pushed to July or August.

The bottom line:

• Competitive salary commensurate with experience and credentials

• Company equity, PTO, choose your own holidays, and health care benefits

Final notes:

“If you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life” – cliché, right? Maybe, but our founders live this motto. If you’re looking for a “job”, LEAH Labs probably isn’t for you.

If the above sounds like a fit, and you’re willing to jump into a fast-paced startup environment with a growing team of exceptional scientists, please send your C.V. and a few sentences about why you’re ready to build cell therapies for dogs to wes@leahlabs.com.
